# Billboard-System

A simple client-server application for distributing and displaying 'billboards' or images to consumer applications. 
This was a uni-based group project which aimed to introduce the client-server architecture to students. 
For this project, I was primarily responsible for the server-side implementation. 
This includes the server application itself, connectors for the client application such as the clientHandler service,
authentication and authorization, and client-server request handling. 
This was the first 'advanced' project I worked on during my time at university, involving various components and serivces to create a complete application.
